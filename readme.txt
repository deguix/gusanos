- Introduction

 GUSANOS is yet YET another clone of Liero (just google
 for 'Liero' if you don't know the original game).

 In the same fashion used by the author of Liero, the name
 'GUSANOS' was chosen for being the Spanish word for
 'Worms'.


- Instructions

 To start playing just run the file named 'gusanos.exe'.

 To play on splitscreen mode change the console variable
 "CL_SPLITSCREEN" to 1 and change map. This will be part
 of the menu in future versions of gusanos.

 To add a bot use the console command "ADDBOT"
 
 The game controls are set in the file named config.cfg in
 the default folder.
